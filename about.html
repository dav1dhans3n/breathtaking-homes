                <p>Brad's path to becoming an entrepreneur started with small to large home improvement 
                  projects at home while growing up.  It seemed like his parents were always working on

                <p>In 2016, Brad Hansen began Breathtaking Homes with small projects as he learned
                  to run a business. The projects grew, his team grew, his business grew, then his family
                  grew as he married the love of his life Stephanie in 2019. And now their family has grown 
                  with the addition of Gracie in 2021!
